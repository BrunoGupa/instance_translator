# RL_MFP

This repository contains a translator from instances of the Moving Firefighter Problem (MFP) into the Bulldozer environment. The MFP is a problem derived from graph theory. Here, we provide an implementation to translate instances of the MFP into an environment suitable for solving with Deep Reinforcement Learning using the Bulldozer framework.

## Results

We share the results of running both algorithms (MFP and Bulldozer) on translated instances:
